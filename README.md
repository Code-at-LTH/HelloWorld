# HelloWorld
This is HelloWorld implemented in Java as an Eclipse project.

To download and modify it, open the git bash/shell program, navigate to your Eclipse
workspace of choice, and enter the command `git clone https://github.com/Code-at-LTH/HelloWorld.git`.
You can then open Eclipse and work on the project in that workspace.

If you wish to host your modifications on GitHub, you should [fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
and clone that repo instead.
